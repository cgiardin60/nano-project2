# Udacity Nanodegree Program - Introduction to Machine Learning : Project II- build an Image Classifier

This repo contains code for my final submission for the Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program- Project II, IMage Classifier.

 In this project, an image classifier is built first in a Jupyter notebook with  PyTorch, then it is converted to  command line application - for both building /training a model, and then predicting the type of  (flower ) image in an image firel.
